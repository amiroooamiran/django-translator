The Django translator module can work in two parts, one part in the backend and the other part in the frontend.

### How to work in the Backend 

In the backend, this library can take your Inputs(CharField, TextField) translate them, and show you the original text and its translation together on the page of admin, so that if it needs corrections, you can correct it.

### How to work in the Frontend

In the front, you can call the front model from the library and then use it in your HTML tags under the Model Fields in the way I will explain, the module itself recognizes your tag text and then with the buttons Personalization that comes on your site, you can read the translated text in several languages.
