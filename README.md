# Django-translator

Django-translator is a library which can provide both frontend and backend codes.

### How to work in the Backend 

In backend, it can take your inputs(charField, TextField) then translate them, putting both the original text and the translation together, showing it to the wabsites's admin so you can correct it if needed.

### How to work in the Frontend

In frontend, you can call the front model from the library and then use it in your html tags under the Model Fields. The model fields are described later in this tutorial . the module itself will recogniz your tag text and then you can translate your text to multiple languages using the personalized buttons available in your website.
